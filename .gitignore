# Visual Studio 2015 user specific files

###################### All exceptions here
#This pattern (!allow, ignore contents, !allow) is how one subfolder is allowed. Several weblinks confirm.
# In our case the bsk plugin has ThirdParty resources that our .gitignore would filter out so even though we
# want to store it in source control we need a sub repo with its own more relaxed .gitignore that saves it properly.
# In our case we went further since the bsk plugin is nearly 2GB so we put it into another repo
# so we don't want it at all in this repo. BUT we want our SocketIO plugin (which doesn't have .git breaking issues)
